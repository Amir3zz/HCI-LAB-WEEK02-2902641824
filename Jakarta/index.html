    <h1>Jakarta</h1>
    <h3>What you need to know</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Jakarta, officially the Specific
        Region of Jakarta (Indonesian: Daerah Khusus Jakarta; DKJ) and formerly known as Batavia until 1949, is the
        capital and largest city of Indonesia and an autonomous region at the provincial level. Lying on the northwest
        coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in Southeast Asia and serves
        as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN. The Specific Region has a status equivalent to that of a province and is
        bordered by the province of West Java to the south and east and Banten to the west. Its coastline faces the Java
        Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west. Jakarta's metropolitan area is
        ASEAN's second largest economy after Singapore. In 2023, the city's GDP PPP was estimated at US$724.010 billion.

        <br><br>

        Jakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia. Although Jakarta extends over only 661.23
        km2 (255.30 sq mi) and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its metropolitan area covers
        7,076.31 km2 (2,732.18 sq mi), which includes the satellite cities of Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang,
        and Bekasi, and has an estimated population of 32.6 million as of 2022, making it the largest urban area in
        Indonesia and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo). Jakarta ranks first among the Indonesian provinces
        in the human development index. Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer
        a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from
        across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.

        <br><br>

        Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century
        as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one time, it was the de
        facto capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was officially a city within West
        Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a province with special capital region distinction. As a
        province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an
        alpha world city and the ASEAN secretariat's seat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia,
        Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational
        corporations are located in the city. Jakarta, as Indonesia’s largest Muslim-majority city, is known for its
        tradition of religious tolerance and pluralism. The Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, stands as a
        symbol of the city’s commitment to interfaith harmony.

        <br><br>

        Jakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, air pollution, gridlocked traffic,
        congestion, and flooding due to subsidence and water extraction (sea level rise is relative, not absolute). Part
        of North Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm (6.7 inches) annually, meanwhile the southern part is relatively safe.
        This has made the northern part of the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in
        the world. In response to these challenges, in August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced plans to move the
        capital from Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara, in the province of East Kalimantan on the island of
        Borneo. The MPR approved the move on 18 January 2022. The Indonesian government is not abandoning Jakarta after
        announcing plans to move the country's capital, its planning minister said, pledging to spend US$40 billion,
        which is more than the cost to build Nusantara, to save the city in the next decade.
