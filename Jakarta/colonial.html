    <p>When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress.
        His army and their EIC allies, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan
        Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the EIC trading post and forced them to retreat to their ships. The victory
        consolidated Dutch power, and they renamed the city Batavia in 1619.

        Commercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden
        population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict
        Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and
        natives on 9 October 1740, and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city
        walls. At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that
        changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics, mainly imported cotton,
        batik and clothing worn by Arab communities.

        The city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the
        port. The Koningsplein, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in
        1913, and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area. By 1930, Batavia had more than
        500,000 inhabitants, including 37,067 Europeans. The city was expanded in 1935 through the annexation of
        the town of Meester Cornelis, modern Jatinegara.

        On 5 March 1942, the Japanese captured Batavia from Dutch control, and the city was named Jakarta (Jakarta
        Special City (ジャカルタ特別市, Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi), under the special status that was assigned to the city). After
        the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until full Indonesian independence on 27 December
        1949. The city, now renamed Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia. </p>
