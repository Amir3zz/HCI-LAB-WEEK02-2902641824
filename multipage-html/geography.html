                        The southernmost country in Asia, Indonesia lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N and
                        longitudes 95°E and 141°E. It is also a transcontinental country, spanning Southeast Asia
                        and Oceania and is the world's largest archipelagic state, stretching 5,120 kilometres
                        (3,181 mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south. The
                        exact number of Indonesia's islands varies according to different sources, usually ranging
                        from 13,000 to 17,000, with around 922 permanently inhabited. Its five largest islands are
                        Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared
                        with Papua New Guinea).

                        Indonesia's equatorial position ensures a relatively stable climate year-round,
                        characterised by two main seasons: the dry season from May to October and the wet season
                        from November to April, with no extremes of summer and winter. The climate is
                        predominantly tropical rainforest, with cooler climates in higher areas over 500 metres
                        (1,600 feet) above sea level. In Indonesia's highland regions, the climate is cooler and
                        wetter than in the lowlands. Areas near tropical rainforests tend to receive consistent
                        rainfall year-round (Köppen: Cfb), while those closer to monsoon and savanna regions have
                        more distinct dry seasons (Köppen: Cwb)
